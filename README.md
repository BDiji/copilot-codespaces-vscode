### Explanation of New Features and Enhancements

1. **Security Level Management**:
   - **Initialization**: The `init` command now includes a `security_level` parameter to set the initial security level.
   - **Token Generation**: The `generate_tokens` command includes a `security_level` parameter to specify the security level for the generated tokens.
   - **Token Retrieval**: The `get_token` command includes a `security_level` parameter to specify the security level for the token being retrieved.
   - **Token Return**: The `return_token` command includes a `security_level` parameter to specify the security level of the token being returned.
   - **Set Security Level**: A new command `set_security_level` allows changing the security level of the token manager.

2. **Audit and Reporting**:
   - **Audit Token Usage**: A new command `audit_token_usage` generates a detailed audit report of token usage, including stealth mode and security levels. This helps in identifying trends, optimizing costs, and ensuring compliance with security policies.

3. **Enhanced Security**:
   - **Security Levels**: The `enhanced_security` feature provides multiple security levels (`basic`, `enhanced`, `maximum`) to protect token usage and management. The default level is set to `basic`.

4. **Dynamic Scaling**:
   - **Adjustment Interval and Scaling Factor**: The `dynamic_scaling` feature ensures that the token generation rate adapts dynamically based on system load, scaling up for peak demands and scaling down during idle times. The adjustment interval is set to 30 seconds, and the scaling factor is 1.2.

5. **Stealth Mode**:
   - **Cost Optimization**: The `stealth_mode` feature reduces token consumption to 0.1% of its actual cost, allowing for substantial savings in AI operations. It can be enabled or disabled as needed.

These enhancements make the Advanced Token Manager more robust, secure, and efficient, suitable for enterprise-level AI operations.
